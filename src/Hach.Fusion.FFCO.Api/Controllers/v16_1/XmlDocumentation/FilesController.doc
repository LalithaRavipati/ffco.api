    <remarks>
      <p>
      The "Try it out!" feature (executed when the "Try it out!" button below is pressed) for this
      API method will display gibberish in the Response Body text box. This is because the file is
      downloaded as a binary. It may also take a long time to execute if the file being
      "downloaded" is large.
